Based on the book *Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity* by Dr. Peter Attia, here is a detailed checklist for reviewing your medical records to identify potential missing tests, along with the rationale for each.

### **I. Assessing Metabolic Health**

A core theme of *Outlive* is that metabolic dysfunction is a key driver of the "Four Horsemen" of chronic disease: atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), cancer, neurodegenerative disease, and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, a deep assessment of your metabolic health is paramount.

**Tests to Look For:**

* **Comprehensive Lipoprotein Panel, including Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentration:**
    * **Rationale:** Standard cholesterol panels that focus on LDL-C ("bad cholesterol") and HDL-C ("good cholesterol") are described as "oversimplified to the point of uselessness." The number of ApoB-containing particles is a more direct and accurate measure of cardiovascular disease risk. Lp(a) is identified as the most prevalent hereditary risk factor for heart disease and often goes undiagnosed. A once-in-a-lifetime test for Lp(a) is recommended.
* **Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) with Insulin Measurements:**
    * **Rationale:** This test can reveal hyperinsulinemia (chronically elevated insulin), which is an early sign of insulin resistance that precedes high blood glucose. Dr. Attia argues that hyperinsulinemia should be treated as a serious endocrine disorder in its own right, as it is a significant risk factor for all the Horsemen diseases.
* **Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) Levels:**
    * **Rationale:** Elevated ALT can be an early indicator of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a condition that is a precursor to more severe metabolic problems, including type 2 diabetes. The book cautions that "normal" lab ranges for ALT may not be "optimal," and even levels within the standard range could be a sign of underlying issues.
* **Uric Acid Levels:**
    * **Rationale:** High uric acid is linked to high blood pressure and can promote fat storage, serving as an early warning sign for metabolic dysfunction.
* **Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) Data (even for a short period):**
    * **Rationale:** CGM provides real-time feedback on how an individual's blood glucose responds to different foods, exercise, and sleep. This data is invaluable for personalizing a nutritional strategy to maintain stable blood glucose, which is crucial for preventing metabolic disease.
* **DEXA Scan for Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT):**
    * **Rationale:** It's not just total body fat that matters, but where it's stored. Visceral fat, the fat surrounding your internal organs, is highly inflammatory and strongly linked to increased risk for cancer and cardiovascular disease. Dr. Attia emphasizes that a person can be "skinny" but still have dangerous levels of visceral fat.

### **II. Assessing Cardiovascular Health**

Heart disease is the leading cause of death, yet Dr. Attia argues it is highly preventable if addressed early and aggressively.

**Tests to Look For:**

* **CT Angiogram:**
    * **Rationale:** This is preferred over a standard calcium scan because it can identify both calcified ("hard") plaque and noncalcified ("soft") plaque. Soft plaque is often more dangerous and precedes calcification, making its detection crucial for early intervention.
* **Comprehensive ApoB and Lp(a) Panel:** (See Metabolic Health section for rationale)
* **Blood Pressure Monitoring:**
    * **Rationale:** While a standard part of most physicals, the book stresses that controlling blood pressure is a "non-negotiable first step" in reducing cardiovascular risk because hypertension directly damages the endothelium (the lining of the arteries).

### **III. Assessing Cancer Risk (Early Detection)**

The book's strategy for cancer focuses heavily on aggressive and early screening, as treatments are far more effective when cancers are caught at an early stage.

**Tests to Look For:**

* **Colonoscopy:**
    * **Rationale:** Recommended to begin at age 40 for average-risk individuals, and sooner for those at higher risk, rather than the standard 45 or 50. A colonoscopy is a powerful tool because it allows for both the detection and removal of precancerous polyps in a single procedure.
* **Mammogram, Ultrasound, and/or MRI for Breast Cancer:**
    * **Rationale:** The book advocates for a multi-modal approach to breast cancer screening to improve accuracy and reduce false positives, moving beyond a simple mammogram.
* **Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) test with additional parameters (PSA velocity, density, free PSA):**
    * **Rationale:** A simple PSA number is not enough. Looking at the change in PSA over time (velocity) and in relation to prostate size (density) provides a much more nuanced and accurate picture of risk, helping to avoid unnecessary biopsies.
* **Low-Dose CT Scan for Lung Cancer:**
    * **Rationale:** Recommended for a wider population than just current or former smokers, given that about 15% of lung cancers occur in never-smokers.
* **Liquid Biopsy (e.g., Galleri test):**
    * **Rationale:** This emerging technology can detect trace amounts of cancer-cell DNA in the blood, potentially identifying cancers at a much earlier stage than imaging can. It is particularly useful for detecting more aggressive cancers that shed more DNA.

### **IV. Assessing Neurodegenerative Disease Risk**

Prevention is presented as the only viable strategy against Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.

**Tests to Look For:**

* **APOE Genotype Test:**
    * **Rationale:** Knowing your APOE status, particularly if you carry the *e4* allele, is critical for understanding your risk level for Alzheimer's disease. This knowledge allows for a more aggressive and personalized prevention strategy, focusing heavily on metabolic and cardiovascular health.
* **Comprehensive Cognitive and Memory Testing Battery:**
    * **Rationale:** These tests go far beyond simple memory screens to assess various domains of cognitive function. They can distinguish between normal age-related changes and the subtle, early signs of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, long before a clinical diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).
* **Hearing Test:**
    * **Rationale:** Hearing loss is strongly associated with cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. The book suggests this may be causal, as hearing loss can lead to social withdrawal and reduced brain stimulation.
* **Sleep Study (to rule out sleep apnea):**
    * **Rationale:** Sleep apnea is highly prevalent and underdiagnosed. It is a serious medical problem that can significantly increase the risk for both cardiovascular disease and dementia.

### **V. Assessing Overall Physical Fitness and Function**

Physical capability is a cornerstone of healthspan, and specific metrics can predict longevity even more powerfully than traditional medical markers.

**Tests to Look For:**

* **VO₂ max Test:**
    * **Rationale:** Described as "perhaps the single most powerful marker for longevity." Low cardiorespiratory fitness carries a greater mortality risk than smoking. Knowing your VO₂ max allows you to train specifically to improve it, which is essential for maintaining physical function in later decades.
* **DEXA Scan for Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and Lean Muscle Mass:**
    * **Rationale:** Screening for low bone density (osteopenia/osteoporosis) should begin much earlier than the standard recommendations of age 65 or 70. Maintaining muscle mass is crucial, as low muscle mass is associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality. The book advocates for tracking these numbers annually.
* **Grip Strength Test:**
    * **Rationale:** Grip strength is presented as an excellent proxy for overall strength and is strongly and inversely associated with the incidence of dementia and all-cause mortality.
